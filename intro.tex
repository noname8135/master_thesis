Nowadays, as the popularity of public clouds like Google cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2 increases, cloud computing has offered a new way of deploying applications and services. While users tend to move everything onto the clouds, handling the growth of volume and complexity of data center network (DCN) is getting challenging. Consequently, networking organizations are under increasing pressure of being more efficient, agile and maintainable. In traditional networks, implementing a network-wide policy requires configuring at the device level. The process is time-consuming, error-prone and manpower-heavy, and it is a formidable job for network administrators to manage a large network.

Software defined network (SDN) is a dynamic, programmable, cost-effective network structure that gains great popularity in the industry and academia in recent years \cite{KRVRAU15, MABPPRST08, LHM10}{\color{red} Refer to some popular SDN tutorial papers here}. In SDN, a controller centrally manage a number of switches in a consistent manner, and network applications can be developed on the controller for flexible management. The controller is able to control all network flows by configuring flow rules inside the switches. Also, components of legacy network such as a regular switch is totally compatible within a SDN network structure {\color{red} Add a reference to justify this sentence}. {\color{red} You can merge the first and the second paragraph, and shorten the sentences in the original first paragraph.}

Nevertheless, SDN often comes with new security problems \cite{SOS13, CM}{\color{red} Refer to some popular SDN security survey papers here}. Aside from controller and applications, there are also some new mechanisms such as topology discovery, host management, protocols and APIs for the communication between entities. With so many new elements introduced, there will be more potential security issues that need to be taken care of in various ways. For instances, applications may be malicious, topology discover and host management mechanism can be leveraged to launch MITM or DOS attack, control channel should be secured carefully, switches and hosts may be compromised {\color{red} This sentence is very confusing}. {\color{red} Briefly summarize the categories of security issues in SDN here.}

Malicious hosts are more common {\color{red} more common than what?} and have already been widely discussed {\color{red} cite a few papers about that work. You said ``widely''.}. For example, in \cite{HXWG15}, Hong et al. studied the attacks that poison network visibility and its countermeasure, but the situation that switches are compromised is not considered. We will focus on the hazards a compromised switch might bring. A compromised switch is able to modify its own flow entries, causing undesired behaviors like forwarding or packet dropping. It can also be connected to a malicious controller and influence the control traffic in the network. Another type of attack is to exploit the topology discovery mechanism, making the controller into believing the existence of non-existing links. 

In this work, we present a method to discover compromised switches if they do not follow the flow rules set by the controller or claim fake links between switches. To the best of our knowledge, although some protection methods are proposed {\color{red} Cite Prof. Lei's paper}, there has not been an efficient way to detect if there is any switch being compromised in the network {\color{red} Briefly explain why.}. In this work, we present a method to reduce the cost of detecting compromised switches and speed up the entire detection process. The detection method in {\color{red} Cite Prof. Lei's paper} is able to detect whether a flow entry works as expected. However, it tests only one flow entry at a time, which is inefficient in a large network. Instead, we fabricate the detection packets so that each can test multiple flow entries on multiple switches at a time by exploiting identical match field values or exclusive match fields in the flow entries. We also present a new detection method that is able to detect a fabricated link caused by LLDP packets manipulation. The main idea is to measure the round trip time of LLDP packets. If an intermediate switch is compromised and manipulates the LLDP packet, it is very likely to increase the round trip time. Nevertheless, time measurement will be significantly influenced by network congestion. Therefore, we implement \textit{packet pair} to meditate this problem. With two packets sent at the same time, we are able to estimate the delay of traffic congestion by using the arrival time of two packets.

The \emph{main contributions of this paper} are as follow {\color{red} The items in the list should be more concrete}:
\begin{enumerate}
