Software defined network (SDN) is a next-generation concept that allows network administrator to manage network flows a lot easier. It is programmable, centrally managed, and flexible with topology alteration. However, these new features also lead to new security problems. Applications, controllers, Openflow switches, topology managing mechanism, there are a lot of newly-introduced vectors for us to concern about. Although protection mechanisms such as TopoGuard and FortNox have been proposed, there are still more possibilities of attacks and countermeasures in different scenarios left to be discovered. Furthermore, as SDN evolves, it will definitely bring more new security issues. In this paper, we analysis several types of topology-related attacks, enhance the efficiency of existing switch detection method, and create an method that is able to detect topology poisoning attacks by using the standard functionality of OpenFlow switch. To reduce the number of detection packets, we try to aggregating the flow entries. Time measuring technique is used to judge if there is any malicious node inside the network. We also implement packet pair to ensure the time measuring method is stable under different network condition. The result of the experiment shows that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
