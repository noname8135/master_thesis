	Software defined network (SDN) is a next-generation concept that allows network administrator to manage network flows a lot easier. It is programmable, centrally managed, and able to adapt to the change of topology. Meanwhile, these characteristics also lead to new security problems, which some have already been discussed and proven. Although people give out some protection mechanisms and suggestions, there are still more possibilities of attacks and countermeasures in different scenarios left to be discovered. And as SDN evolves, it will definitely bring more new security issues. In this paper, we analysis several types of topology-related attacks, enhance the efficiency of existing detection method, and create a new method that is able to detect topology poisoning attacks by using the standard functionality of OpenFlow switch. We evaluate our method under different conditions, and discuss about the work.
