	Software defined network (SDN) is a next-generation concept that allows network administrator to manage network flows with ease. It is programmable, centrally managed, and being able to adapt to the change of topology. Meanwhile, these characteristics also leads to new security problems, which some have already been discussed and proven. And people also give out great protection mechanisms and suggestions. However, there are still more possibilities of attacks in different scenario left to be discovered. And as SDN evolves, it will definitely cause some more new issues. In this paper, we analsis several types of topology-related attacks, and create a method that is able to detect topology poisoning attacks by using the standard functionality of OpenFlow switch. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method under different conditions, and discuss the possibility of future works.
