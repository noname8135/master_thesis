In this work, we classify the web application and focus on the five categories of web applications: office application, map application, game application, video streaming application and file sharing application. The statistical features are extracted from application-level and need not to analyze the packet payloads, so we do not have to concern about the network condition and the encryption issue. All of the data sets are generated artificially, so the condition is close to reality. This work uses Weka and 10-fold cross-validation for evaluating the classification accuracy.

The experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy can be as high as 98.75\% and the false-positive rate is no more than 0.017 using random forest for the interaction functions. For the download functions, the accuracy can be up to 97.00\% and the false-positive rate can be 0.025 for each algorithm. For the five functions, the accuracy can be up to 93.89\% and the false-positive rate can be 0.007 using random forest. For the early classification, the accuracy can be up to 93.89\% and the false-positive rate is no more than 0.036 using random forest. Finally, the results show that the feature can effectively classify traffic of various web applications, and even in early classification.
